This project is developed using Scala plug-in for eclipse:
http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94

The simplest way to build and run this project is also using this plug-in. 
Install Eclipse and mentioned plug-in (plug-in comes with Scala SDK) - nothing else is needed.

To taste SPSC light in eclipse select Sample.scala -> Run as -> Scala Application.

Enjoy!
